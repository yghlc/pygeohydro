This is a forked version of [pygeohydro](https://github.com/hyriver/pygeohydro). 
In this version, I added function to download daily mean gage height (unit: feet)


### install 
```
# pip install pygeohydro  # pip verison, if we use the released version 

git clone https://github.com/yghlc/pygeohydro 
cd pygeohydro 

#  install from the developer version
# pip install -e pygeohydro # not working, the folder don't have setup.py but have pyproject.toml
pip install .               # use this command to install 

```
